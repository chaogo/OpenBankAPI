# OpenBankAPI

A lightweight banking API that provides customer registration, logon, open account, and account overview features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for dependency and environment management.

### Setup

```Bash
# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

### Run
```Bash
uv run uvicorn main:app
```

### Test
- Health check
    ```Bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
    ```
- Automated test using pytest with coverage
    ```Bash
    pytest
    ```
- Populate the database with sample data for easier manual testing
    ```Bash
    uv run python seed.py
    ```
- Interactive testing using Postman collection: `OpenBankAPI.postman_collection.json`

### API documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Design
Although it‚Äôs a small project, my goal was to make it correct, clean, and complete.
- Correct and clean can be achieved along the way by careful coding and structure.
- Complete requires more design thinking and trade-offs, especially since the assignment leaves space for interpretation.

### Tech Stack
Since this is a demo project requiring fast development
- SQLite was the natural database choice ‚Äî it‚Äôs lightweight and avoids setup overhead. 
- Python was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use, plus SQLite is built-in.
- FastAPI was chosen as Python was chosen, plus I had a little prior experience using Flask in another personal project.

### Business Interpretation
The specification left some gaps. For example:
- /register requires address, ID document, and country, but doesn‚Äôt specify which field should determine the customer‚Äôs country.
- /logon only expects a success response, making it more like a credential check than a real login process.
- /overview should give a customer overview. It‚Äôs intuitive that a customer might have multiple accounts, but there‚Äôs no explicit endpoint to create accounts, and it‚Äôs unclear if an account needs to be created automatically when a customer registers.
- It should be possible to add new countries to the allowed list "easily".

Here is my interpretation:
- /register uses the country field to validate if registration is allowed.
- /logon issues a JWT token when credentials are correct, so customers don‚Äôt need to re-enter credentials every time.
- One customer can hold multiple accounts, so an extra endpoint /accounts/open is added.
- A dedicated table for allowed countries is created for flexibility.

### Technical Trade-offs
- In a real bank, an **ID document** would need to be uploaded and verified against other information, including the allowed country. Here, it‚Äôs simplified as a plain string field of ID number.
- Database migrations (Alembic) are skipped to keep things lightweight; instead, the schema is reset when needed.
- Database error handling is minimal to keep it simple ‚Äî e.g. integrity errors are not mapped in detail, and DB failure is not mocked.

### Future Improvements
- **Refresh tokens** to support longer and more secure user sessions.
- **bcrypt password hashing** instead of storing plaintext passwords.
- **Admin role** to manage allowed countries, and supported currencies.
- Business rules such as preventing duplicate account types per customer.


## üìñ Reflection
This project gave me strong motivation to strengthen my Python and backend development skills. 
I really enjoyed the cycle of analyzing, designing, learning, implementing, and refining on a project of my own. 
One highlight was to quickly pick up new tools and apply them directly in the project ‚Äî such as FastAPI, Pydantic, uv, pytest, and Faker. 
That‚Äôs also why I tried to write down detailed commits and messages, to clearly show how the project evolved from scratch.

I also gained valuable experience working with GPT as a mentor-like assistant. It gave me quick help by:
- Broadening my view with tools and libraries I hadn‚Äôt considered, e.g., Faker for sample test data
- Clarifying unfamiliar syntax and semantics, such as forward references with SQLModel
- Suggesting architectural improvements, like restructuring into models/, schemas/, and routers/ packages, and introducing .env configs.
- Assisting with utility functions (e.g. generating IBANs, generating secure passwords), so I could focus on business logic while still reviewing and testing helper code.
- Sharing domain knowledge, such as IBAN format, ISO country codes, etc.

Meanwhile, GPT doesn‚Äôt always provide the most optimal or up-to-date approach. 
It often suggests the most common way (sometimes older or deprecated practices), and I had to guide it toward newer alternatives ‚Äî for example:
- `@app.on_event("startup")` vs. the modern **lifespan** event handler.
- `session.query()` vs. `session.exec(select(...))`.
- 
It also didn‚Äôt fully solve data schema redundancy issues, which I later learned about through the official FastAPI templates.
From this, I learned that the best approach might be a combination: following structured courses for comprehensive understanding, while using AI tools for quick help and idea exploration.
